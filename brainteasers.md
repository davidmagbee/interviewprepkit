# Brain Teasers

## Tips
- [ ] Remember that these questions are not about finding the exact solution/answer. These are mostly to determine if you can break down an obscure problem and logically reason through it. 
- [ ] Make sure you're verbalizing your thought process. Take a minute to break down the problem and then talk through what you're thinking.
- [ ] If you're making an assumption - make sure to clearly articulate that. Feel free to ask questions to narrow down the answers too. For example, for a question about participants in a tournament, how many people are on a given team?

## Questions:
- [ ] The smallest city in the United States is in Utah and has 1 resident. The largest city in the United States is New York City with approximately 8,550,405 residents. Give this information, how would you esimate the population of the United States?

- [ ] How many windows would you estimate are in the city of Chicago. 
- [ ] Given 2 sand timers (1 that counts 7 minutes, the other counts 11 minutes) - how would you use these two to calculate 15 minutes of time.
- [ ] If you had an infinite supply of water and a 5-liter and 3-lite bucket, how would you measure exactly 4 liters of water. The buckets don't have intermediate scales. 
- [ ] A farmer has to cross a river with a can of beans, a goat, and a fox. The farmer can only take one of the 3 across the river at any given point. If the beans are left with the goat, the goat will eat the beans. If the fox is left with the goat, the fox will eat the goat. What are the least amount of trips (a trip counts as a trip in one direction) does the farmer need to take to make sure all of the 3 are safely transported across. 
- [ ] Given 12 balls, one of which heavier than the rest, and a scale. What is the minimum number of weighs that you need in order to determine the heaviest ball from the bunch?
- [ ] There are 10 bikes each with a tank that has the capcity to go 100 km. Using all 10 bikes, what is the maximim distance you can go?
- [ ] You have two light bulbs in a 100-story building. You want to find the floor at which the bulbs will break when dropped. Find the floor using the least number of drops. 
- [ ] You have 5,623 participants in a tournament. How many games would need to be played to determine the winner?

- [ ] Imagine that you have three boxes, one containing two black marbles, one containing two white marbles, and the third, one black marble and one white marble. The boxes were labeled for their contents - BB, WW, BW - but someone has switched the labels so that every box is now incorrectly labeled. You are allowed to take one marble at a time out of any box, without looking inside, and by this process of sampling, you are to determine the contents of all three boxes. What is the smallest number of drawings needed to do this?
- [ ] If you have a square room with no roof, and you had four flagpoles you had to plant on the walls so that each flagpole touched two walls, how would you do it?
- [ ] You toss two coins. If you get heads with the first coin, you stop. If you get tails, you toss it again. The second coin is tossed regardless. What is the ratio of heads to tails?
- [ ] You have 2 pieces of rope, each of which burns from one end to the other in 30 minutes (no matter which end is lit). If different pieces touch, the flame will transfer from one to the other. You cannot assume any rope properties that were not stated. Given only 1 match, can you time 45 minutes?
