## Tips
All of these questions are somewhat vague, make sure to clearly state your assumptions when doing the problems. 

## Easy
- [ ] Given an array or list, return the largest difference between any two consecutive numbers. 
- [ ] Print a staircase of size n using hashtags and spaces.
- [ ] The largest Palindrome that is the product of 2 2-digit numbers is 9009 (multiply 91 times 99). What is the largest Palindrome that is a product of 2 3-digit numbers?
- [ ] Write a function that takes an input array ex:([], [Peter, John]). Return a string that lists all the people who are in the array. (i.e. "No one is in the array.", "Peter and John are in the array.")
- [ ] Part 1: write a function that takes in a string and a number (n) (i.e. ("Hello, 3)). The function should return that string n number of times. (i.e. "HelloHelloHello"). Part 2: Use prototypes to create a string method that accomplishes the same task. 
- [ ] Write a function that takes in an array of prices for a particular stock and returns the best possible profit based on buy low sell high philosophies. (Ex: input: [10,7,5,8,11,9] => output: 6 (difference between 5 and 11)). 
- [ ] Write a function that takes 2 arguments: the desired length of an array (n) and 2 the maximum number of values in the array (max). Based on this, output an array that produces an array of n length that has unique values all under the max value. (Ex: inputs: n = 5, max = 10 => POSSIBLE output: [2,8,4,3,9]

## Medium
- [ ] Given 2 strings, create a function that returns the number of common characters in the strings. 
- [ ] Given 2 strings, create a function that determines if the strings are anagrams of one another. 
- [ ] Given 2 arrays/lists, create a function that returns a sorted list of all duplicates. 
- [ ] Given a grid of inputs, determine the maximum product of any 4 adjacent values (can be horizontal, diagonal, or vertical).

Example Input: [[8,2,22,97,38,15,0,40,0,75],[49,19,99,40,17,81,18,57,60,87],[81,49,31,73,55,79,14,29,93,71],[52,70,95,23,4,60,11,42,69,24],[22,31,16,71,51,67,63,89,41,92],[24,47,32,60,99,3,45,2,44,75],[32,98,81,28,64,23,67,10,26,38],[67,26,20,68,2,62,12,20,95,63],[24,55,58,5,66,73,99,26,97,17],[21,36,23,9,75,0,76,44,20,45]]
`
- [ ] In the fibonacci sequence, find the sum of all even values under 4,000,000. 
- [ ] Write a function that converts a given integer into binary and then returns the longest length of consecutive 1's in the sequence. (Ex: input: 60 => 111100 in binary => output: 4)
- [ ] Write a function that takes in an array of n numbers and for each index finds the prout of each integer in the array other than the current index. (Ex: input: [1,2,3,4] => ouput: [24,12,8,6])
