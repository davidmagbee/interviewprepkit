## Tips
All of these questions are somewhat vague, make sure to clearly state your assumptions when doing the problems. 

## Easy
- [ ] Given an array or list, return the largest difference between any two consecutive numbers. 
- [ ] Print a staircase of size n using hashtags and spaces.
`Example:
for n = 6:
     #
    ##
   ###
  ####
 #####
######`

- [ ] The largest Palindrome that is the product of 2 2-digit numbers is 9009 (multiply 91 times 99). What is the largest Palindrome that is a product of 2 3-digit numbers?
- [ ] Write a function that takes an input array ex:([], [Peter, John]). Return a string that lists all the people who are in the array. (i.e. "No one is in the array.", "Peter and John are in the array.")


## Medium
- [ ] Given 2 strings, create a function that returns the number of common characters in the strings. 
- [ ] Given 2 strings, create a function that determines if the strings are anagrams of one another. 
- [ ] Given 2 arrays/lists, create a function that returns a sorted list of all duplicates. 
- [ ] Given a grid of inputs, determine the maximum product of any 4 adjacent values (can be horizontal, diagonal, or vertical).

Input: [[8,2,22,97,38,15,0,40,0,75],[49,19,99,40,17,81,18,57,60,87],[81,49,31,73,55,79,14,29,93,71],[52,70,95,23,4,60,11,42,69,24],[22,31,16,71,51,67,63,89,41,92],[24,47,32,60,99,3,45,2,44,75],[32,98,81,28,64,23,67,10,26,38],[67,26,20,68,2,62,12,20,95,63],[24,55,58,5,66,73,99,26,97,17],[21,36,23,9,75,0,76,44,20,45]]

- [ ] In the fibonacci sequence, find the sum of all even values under 4,000,000.
