## Tips
- [ ] Remember that these questions are not about finding the exact solution/answer. These are mostly to determine if you can break down an obscure problem and logically reason through it. 
- [ ] Make sure you're verbalizing your thought process. Take a minute to break down the problem and then talk through what you're thinking.
- [ ] If you're making an assumption - make sure to clearly articulate that. Feel free to ask questions to narrow down the answers too. For example, for a question about participants in a tournament, how many people are on a given team?

## Questions:
- [ ] The smallest city in the United States is in Utah and has 1 resident. The largest city in the United States is New York City with approximately 8,550,405 residents. Give this information, how would you esimate the population of the United States?
<details>
  <summary><strong>Potential Solution</strong></summary> 
The United States has an approximate population of 327 M. You may want to ask about how many major cities there are in the US. How many total cities there are and do some averaging/normal bell curve estimations. Remember this question is more about your process rather than the actual answer. 
</details>

- [ ] How many windows would you estimate are in the city of Chicago. 
<details>
  <summary><strong>Potential Solution</strong></summary> 
First ask how many buildings are in Chicago and try to pin down an average windows per building. This might be made from averaging different samples together. 
</details>

- [ ] Given 2 sand timers (1 that counts 4 minutes, the other counts 7 minutes) - how would you use these two to calculate 9 minutes of time.
<details>
  <summary><strong>Potential Solution</strong></summary> 
Step 1: Start both timers. Step 2: At 4 minutes, timer 1 will be completed, so it should be flipped over. The other timer will have 3 minutes left. Step 3: At 7 minutes, timer 1 will have 1 minute left and the 2nd timer will be completely empty. You should flip over the second timer. Step 4: At 8 minutes, the first timer will be empty again and the second timer will have 6 minutes left. You should flip over the SECOND TIMER to get the final minute. Step 5: Both timers should now be done at 9 minutes. 
</details>

- [ ] If you had an infinite supply of water and a 5-liter and 3-liter bucket, how would you measure exactly 4 liters of water. The buckets don't have intermediate scales. 
<details>
  <summary><strong>Potential Solution</strong></summary> 
Step 1: Fill the 3-liter bucket completely. Step 2: Transfer the contents of the 3-liter bucket to the 5-liter bucket. Step 3: Fill the 3-liter bucket again. Step 4: transfer as much as you can to the 5-liter bucket. At this point there is 1 liter in the 3-liter bucket and the 5-liter bucket is full. Step 5: Empty the 5-liter bucket out completely (do not transfer to the 3-liter.) Step 6: Transfer the 1 liter of water from the 3-liter bucket to the 5-liter bucket. Step 7: Fill up the 3-liter bucket completely. Step 8: Transfer the contents of the 3-liter bucket to the 5-liter bucket. DONE!

- [ ] A farmer has to cross a river with a can of beans, a goat, and a fox. The farmer can only take one of the 3 across the river at any given point. If the beans are left with the goat, the goat will eat the beans. If the fox is left with the goat, the fox will eat the goat. What are the least amount of trips (a trip counts as a trip in one direction) does the farmer need to take to make sure all of the 3 are safely transported across. 
<details>
  <summary><strong>Potential Solution</strong></summary> 
Trip 1: Take the goat to the other side. Trip 2: The farmer returns to the start. Trip 3: The farmer takes the beans across. Trip 4: The farmer unloads the beans and brings the goat back to the start. Trip 5: The farmer takes the fox across. Trip 6: The farmer returns to the start. Trip 7: The farmer takes the goat back across. DONE!
</details>

- [ ] Given 12 balls, one of which heavier than the rest, and a scale. What is the minimum number of weighs that you need in order to determine the heaviest ball from the bunch?
<details>
  <summary><strong>Potential Solution</strong></summary> 
Weigh 1: Split the balls 6 on one side and 6 on the other side. Note which side is heavier. Weigh 2: With the heavier side, split the balls 3 on one side and 3 on the other side. Note which side is heavier. Weigh 3: Take 2 out of 3 balls from the heavier side from the previous weigh. If the scale is balanced, the unweighed ball is the heaviest ball. If the scale is tipping to one direction that ball is the heaviest. DONE!
</details>

- [ ] There are 10 bikes each with a tank that has the capcity to go 100 km. Using all 10 bikes, what is the maximim distance you can go?
<details>
  <summary><strong>Potential Solution</strong></summary> 
Step 1: Take all of the bikes 50 KM. Step 2: Transfer the rest of the fuel from half of the bikes to the other half. Now you have 5 bikes will full tanks! Step 3: Go forward 40 KM. Transfer the fuel again. Step 4: You should now 3 full bikes left. Go forward 33 KM. Transfer the fuel. You now have 2 full bikes. Step 5: Go forward 50 KM. Transfer the fuel. You have one full bike left. Step 6: Go forward 100 Km. Total: 273 KM. 
</details>

- [ ] You have two light bulbs in a 100-story building. You want to find the floor at which the bulbs will break when dropped. Find the floor using the least number of drops. 
<details>
  <summary><strong>Potential Solution</strong></summary> 
At most 16 (varies depending on which floor). Start up the building in increments of 10 dropping a lightbulb. As soon as it breaks go back to the floor that you last tried where it didn't break. Now just go up each floor 1 by 1 and test it. 
</details>

- [ ] You have 5,623 participants in a tournament. How many games would need to be played to determine the winner?
<details>
  <summary><strong>Potential Solution</strong></summary> 
Ask how many members are on each side. Ask if the tournament is single elimation. The answer if it is single elimnation should be the equal to 1 less than the number of teams in the tournament. Ex: March Madness - 68 teams in the bracket (16 * 4 for each region + 4 play-in teams.) There are 67 games played to determine the winner. 
</details>

- [ ] Given 20 socks in a drawer and a completely dark room, what is the minimum number of socks you should grab to ensure you have a matching pair?
<details>
  <summary><strong>Potential Solution</strong></summary> 
11. If you take 10 socks, there is a chance (albeit small) that the socks produce no match. On the 11th, you're guaranteed a match. 
</details>

- [ ] The probability of finding a parking slot occupied is 1/3. You find it empty for 9 consecutive days. Find the probabilty that it will be empty on the 10th day. 
<details>
  <summary><strong>Potential Solution</strong></summary> 
1/3. Because the parking lot being occupied is an independent event, each individual event that happens has the same probability. 
</details>

- [ ] The probability of finding a parking slot occupied is 1/3. What is the probability is empty 10 straight days?
<details>
  <summary><strong>Potential Solution</strong></summary> 
This is a bernoulli event. Each day there is a 2/3 chance that the parking lot is occupied. Thus the chance that the parking lot is empty each of the 10 days is (1/3)^10. So (1/3)^10 = 0.00001693508.
</details>

- [ ] The probability of finding a parking slot occupied is 1/3. What is the probability it is occupied at least 1 out of the ten days? 
<details>
  <summary><strong>Potential Solution</strong></summary> 
This is a bernoulli event. Each day there is a 2/3 chance that the parking lot is occupied. Thus the chance that it is empty each day is (1/3)^10. However, we want the chance that it is empty at least one of the 10 days. We just found the probability that it is empty all 10 days, so just subtract that from 1 to find the probability. 1 - (1/3)^10 = .99998306491.

- [ ] Imagine that you have three boxes, one containing two black marbles, one containing two white marbles, and the third, one black marble and one white marble. The boxes were labeled for their contents - BB, WW, BW - but someone has switched the labels so that every box is now incorrectly labeled. You are allowed to take one marble at a time out of any box, without looking inside, and by this process of sampling, you are to determine the contents of all three boxes. What is the smallest number of drawings needed to do this?
<details>
  <summary><strong>Potential Solution</strong></summary> 
1 draw should suffice. Remember that the contents of the box are correct, but the labels are incorrect. Thus, you should draw a marble from the box labeled BW. This is guaranteed to be either the BB or WW box depending on which color you draw. Let's assume it's white. Now you know that one box is WW. Now that you have that, you have 2 unknown boxes (one labeled incorrectly and one without a label), but you know that the box with the label on it is currently incorrect, so you can just move that label to the other box and use the BW label on it. DONE!
</details>

- [ ] If you have a square room with no roof, and you had four flagpoles you had to plant on the walls so that each flagpole touched two walls, how would you do it?
<details>
  <summary><strong>Potential Solution</strong></summary> 
Put each flag in each of the four corners of the room. 
</details>

- [ ] You toss two coins. If you get heads with the first coin, you stop. If you get tails, you toss it again. The second coin is tossed regardless. What is the ratio of heads to tails?
<details>
  <summary><strong>Potential Solution</strong></summary> 
You would expect the odds of heads or tails to be 50/50 for any tossed coin. You would then expect to toss the first coin at least twice. This should, by rights, give you a ratio of 1 to 1. The second coin is continuously tossed and it should also have a ratio of 1 to 1. Hence the ratio of the two must, therefore, also be 1 to 1.
</details>

- [ ] You have 2 pieces of rope, each of which burns from one end to the other in 30 minutes (no matter which end is lit). If different pieces touch, the flame will transfer from one to the other. You cannot assume any rope properties that were not stated. Given only 1 match, can you time 45 minutes?
<details>
  <summary><strong>Potential Solution</strong></summary> 
Put the first rope at the midpoint of the second rope. Burn either end of the ropes and you'll get 45 minutes. 
</details>

- [ ] In front of you are three light switches. Only one does anything, and it turns on the light downstairs. From here you can't see the light, and it makes no sound. You must determine which switch operates the light. You can only go check it once. How do you figure out which switch is for the light?
<details>
  <summary><strong>Potential Solution</strong></summary> 
The trick here is realize that lightbulbs get hot after being in use. So first flick on the 1st switch on and wait 5 minutes. Then flip the 2nd switch on while turning the 1st switch off and wait another 5 minutes. Then flick the 3rd switch on and the 2nd switch off. Go to the basement immediately. If the light is on, the 3rd switch is the answer. If the light is off and COLD then it would be the 1st switch. If the light is off and warm, it was the 2nd switch. 
</details>

- [ ] You have 1,000 bottles of juice. One contains poison and tastes bitter. How do you find it in the smallest number of sips?
<details>
  <summary><strong>Potential Solution</strong></summary> 
Take a small sample from 500 of the bottles and take a sip. If it tastes bitter it's one of those if not it's the other 500. Then take samples from 250 of the 500 that tasted bitter and keep halving until you find the exact bottle. DONE!
