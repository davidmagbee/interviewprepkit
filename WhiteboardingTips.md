# Whiteboarding Exercises
The following tips are generic and based on the average whiteboarding problem. For some problems, keep in mind you might not really have the capability or time to do the problem. In scenarios like that, I highly recommend that you spend much more time on your pseudocode in order to build a path forward. If you only get halfway done coding, but have no path, it's a lot worse than having a path and having no code. You should also actively acknowledge when you don't know what you're doing - this is better than trying to BS your way through something. 
### Tips: 
- [ ] Split the whiteboard into 3 major sections: Notes (a section to write details of the problem, any inputs or outputs, and edge cases, etc.)
#### Notes Section (First quarter or third of your allotted time if you have a time limit):
- [ ] Make sure to write the problem down for your reference. Ask the interviewer if you don't understand any words in the problem. 
- [ ] Suss out any assumptions. It's better to ask than assume! Bonus points for asking if you can use certain techniques like Recursion, etc.
- [ ] Make sure to ask questions about potential edge cases (what happens if the input number is negative), what the input would be and look like (is it always a string? will it ever be a decimal, etc.) 
- [ ] If possible, ask for a sample input and output. 
- [ ] If you'd like create your own input and output to demonstrate you understand the problem and how it works. Confirm this input and output with the interviewer. 
- [ ] There should be a fair amount of back and forth conversation in this part as you ask questions and they answer. 
#### Pseudocode Section (Second quarter or third of your allotted time if you have a time limit):
- [ ] This section is optional, but recommended if the problem is complicated or has multiple steps - this can be a checklist for you to make sure you do what the problem asks correctly. 
- [ ] Feel free to write anything in this section that could help you including what sort of methods you might want to use.
- [ ] If the interviewer is able to, ask for some sort of confirmation about your psuedocode. This doesn't have to be anything crazy, just something like - "does that sound reasonable to you?". If your interviewer cannot talk or answer your questions, don't worry and move to the next section. 
- [ ] Make sure that while you are writing your psuedocode down you are verbalizing the WHY of what you're doing as well as the WHAT. If you're able to, you might want to acknowledge other possible solutions in order to show the interviewer your breadth of knowledge (this is especially powerful if you can explain why your chosen method is superior to others via Big O, etc.). This is an excellent place to really show your depth of knowledge when it comes to solving problems. 
#### Code Section (This should be the bulk of your time):
- [ ] Always make sure to be verbalizing what you're doing here. It may be a fair amount of reptition from your pseudocode sectiom, but it's good to reinforce your knowledge. If you can't talk and write at the same time, take a break after major sections and explain what you just did (after you write a loop, after an if statement). 
- [ ] Remember to write any part of the code however small. Don't forget to put your function name and any parameters as well as your return statements. Syntax counts! If you don't remember the syntax of something, ask if you're able to. If you can't get any help, it might be best to try another method that you're confident with the syntax. 
- [ ] Give yourself plenty of space to write your code cleanly and with some basic formatting so it's readable. Indent as much as possible. 
- [ ] After any initial passes through your code, feel free to refactor if wanted or necessary. 
- [ ] It's highly recommended that you attempt to talk about your code's efficiency, performance, etc after you're done the first pass. 
#### BEFORE YOU END:
- [ ] Reread the problem and make sure that you followed all directions. Don't be afraid to ask any last clarifying questions here before you say you're done. Does yout output match the output they requested? 
- [ ] It's highly recommended that you check a possible input and manually going through the function and seeing if it would produce the output you expect. 
- [ ] Revisit any edge cases you found before and modify your code to make sure that they are accounted for. 
- [ ] Summarize your work verbally. 
- [ ] Ask for feedback (even if they can't provide any) - this shows that you're eager to learn and grow.
