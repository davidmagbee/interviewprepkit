## What This Is
This is a list of useful methods/techniques to commit to memory in both JavaScript and Python. Each entry will have a small explanation and example of how to use it. Try using these in different algorithms/code challenges to get comfortable with them. 

## Methods

#### Split (JS, Python)
Split will take a string and split the string into individual indexes based on a delimeter. For example for "Hello World", splitting on a " " will produce the array or list ["Hello", "World]. No argument defaults to splitting by a " " character.
