## Whiteboarding Exercises

###Tips: 
- [ ] Split the whiteboard into 3 major sections: Notes (a section to write details of the problem, any inputs or outputs, and edge cases, etc.)
####Notes Section (First quarter or third of your allotted time if you have a time limit):
- [ ] Make sure to write the problem down for your reference. Ask the interviewer if you don't understand any words in the problem. 
- [ ] Suss out any assumptions. It's better to ask than assume! Bonus points for asking if you can use certain techniques like Recursion, etc.
- [ ] Make sure to ask questions about potential edge cases (what happens if the input number is negative), what the input would be and look like (is it always a string? will it ever be a decimal, etc.) 
- [ ] If possible, ask for a sample input and output. 
- [ ] If you'd like create your own input and output to demonstrate you understand the problem and how it works. 
- [ ] There should be a fair amount of back and forth conversation in this part as you ask questions and they answer. 
####Pseudocode Section (Second quarter or third of your allotted time if you have a time limit):
- [ ] This section is optional, but recommended if the problem is complicated or has multiple steps - this can be a checklist for you to make sure you do what the problem asks correctly. 
- [ ] Feel free to write anything in this section that could help you including what sort of methods you might want to use and a verbal version of what you'd be doing in the problem. 
- [ ] If the interviewer is able to, ask for some sort of confirmation about your psuedocode. This doesn't have to be anything crazy, just something like - "does that sound reasonable to you?". If your interviewer cannot talk or answer your questions, don't worry and move to the next section. 
- [ ] Make sure that while you are writing your psuedocode down you are verbalizing the WHY of what you're doing as well as the WHAT. If you're able to, you might want to acknowledge other possible solutions in order to show the interviewer your breadth of knowledge. 
####Code Section (Second quarter or third of your allotted time if you have a time limit):
- [ ] Always make sure to be verbalizing what you're doing here. It may be a fair amount of reptition from your pseudocode sectiom, but it's good to reinforce your knowledge. 
- [ ] Remember to write any part of the code however small. Don't forget to put your function name and any parameters as well as your return statements. Syntax counts!
- [ ] Give yourself plenty of space to write your code cleanly and with some basic formatting so it's readable.
- [ ] After any initial passes through your code, feel free to refactor if wanted or necessary. 
BEFORE YOU END (Second quarter or third of your allotted time if you have a time limit):
- [ ] Reread the problem and make sure that you followed all directions. Don't be afraid to ask any last clarifying questions here before you say you're done. 
- [ ] You might consider even checking a possible input and manually going through the function and seeing if it would produce the output you expect. 
- [ ] Revisit any edge cases you found before and modify your code to make sure that they are accounted for. 
- [ ] Summarize your work
- [ ] Ask for feedback (even if they can't provide any) - this shows that you're eager to learn and grow.
