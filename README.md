# Interview Prep Kit (Junior Developer)

## What This Is / User's Guide
If you're reading this, then you're likely looking for a repository of links and advice for preparing for the various parts of a technical interview for a junior developer or similar job. This repository is designed to be filled with useful links for various aspects of the job process. This content will be built up more as time goes on, and you can help that. If you'd like to add anything, please let me know and I will add it in. 

## Whiteboarding
I'd suggest you take a look at the whiteboarding.md file for any tips or tricks. In general, you should expect any of the simpler algorithms or "brain-teaser" questions to be fair game here. For a list of "brain-teaser" questions look here. 

## Algorithms/Code Challenges
If you're looking for algorithms, checkout the samplealgos.md file in the repository. Here are some excellent and FREE links for different algorithms. Coming Soon: Suggested Algos Links.

Tier 1: 
https://www.codewars.com/ (make sure to focus on Katas between 8kyu and 6kyu. You are welcome to go above that, but they will become increasingly more difficult.)
https://projecteuler.net/ (mathematical problems that force you to write clean and optimized code to solve them)
https://www.hackerrank.com/ (similar to code wars, they even have an interview preparation kit that has different challenges that focus on different concepts: https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit)

Tier 2:
https://leetcode.com/
https://adventofcode.com/2015 , https://adventofcode.com/2016, https://adventofcode.com/2017, https://adventofcode.com/2018, https://adventofcode.com/2019 (these problems get progressively more difficult and are great if you want to focus on interpreting word problems)

Tier 3: 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AvWr9caOK_-9yzRvltOrWBA5fmEyym0MsGxryV8iLu0/edit#gid=421986618 (Algorithms we've already solved in class - great for reference if you want to revisit one for some reason or look at how something is done recursively. You can also complete the ones that you may not have gotten to or solo program the ones you pair programmed!)
