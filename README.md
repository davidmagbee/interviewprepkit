# Interview Prep Kit (Junior Developer)

## What This Is / User's Guide
If you're reading this, then you're likely looking for a repository of links and advice for preparing for the various parts of a technical interview for a junior developer or similar job. This repository is designed to be filled with useful links for various aspects of the job process. This content will be built up more as time goes on, and you can help that. If you'd like to add anything, please let me know and I will add it in. 

## Whiteboarding
I'd suggest you take a look at the whiteboarding.md file for any tips or tricks. In general, you should expect any of the simpler algorithms or "brain-teaser" questions to be fair game here. For a list of "brain-teaser" questions look here. 

## Algorithms/Code Challenges
If you're looking for algorithms, checkout the samplealgos.md file in the repository. To practice as realistically as possible, try not to run your code at all while you are solving the problem. You might not be able to do this during an interview. Here are some excellent and FREE links for different algorithms. Coming Soon: Suggested Algos Links.

Tier 1: 
- [ ] Code Wars: https://www.codewars.com/ (make sure to focus on Katas between 8kyu and 6kyu. You are welcome to go above that, but they will become increasingly more difficult.)
- [ ] Project Euler: https://projecteuler.net/ (mathematical problems that force you to write clean and optimized code to solve them)
- [ ] Hacker Rank: https://www.hackerrank.com/ (similar to code wars, they even have an interview preparation kit that has different challenges that focus on different concepts: https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit)
- [ ] WDI NYC Algorithm Repository (Courtesy: Joe Keohan): https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-nyc-algorithms/whiteboarding-meetup/blob/master/algorithms.md - a list of several common algorithms as well as their respective solutions (sometimes multiple in different methods)


Tier 2:
- [ ] Leet Code: https://leetcode.com/
- [ ] Advent of Code: https://adventofcode.com/2015 , https://adventofcode.com/2016, https://adventofcode.com/2017, https://adventofcode.com/2018, https://adventofcode.com/2019 (these problems get progressively more difficult and are great if you want to focus on interpreting word problems)

Tier 3: 
- [ ] Algos from Class: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AvWr9caOK_-9yzRvltOrWBA5fmEyym0MsGxryV8iLu0/edit#gid=421986618 Courtesy: Joe Keohan (Algorithms we've already solved in class - great for reference if you want to revisit one for some reason or look at how something is done recursively. You can also complete the ones that you may not have gotten to or solo program the ones you pair programmed!)

## Take Home Assignment
Here is a sample take-home assignment. Keep in mind that beyond the actual assignment requirements and suggestions, you should look at the Take Home Assignment Tips guide in the repo.

## General Technical Conceptual Questions
These questions are meant to test your knowledge on a variety of concepts and technologies. For our purposes, you should be able to answer the CLI, Git, Most of Misc (some are Ruby/Rails specific), Express & Mongoose, APIs, RWD, CSS2, Databases, Javascript, OOJS, HTML & CSS, HTTP and React.

## Branding yourself
This is a bonus section for those who would like to improve their personal brand. The best way to get jobs is to network and a great way to network is to interact with existing content on the web (LinkedIn, Medium, etc.) as well as posting your own. Here are a few links that can help you get started with Blogging and Content Creation. Also checkout this for tips on blogging.
